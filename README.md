# AI, Ethics, and the Human Factor in ICT

## Overview

This repository contains a digital learning submission exploring the ethical dimensions of artificial intelligence deployment in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) environments. The project examines the automation-induced redundancy dilemma and proposes human-centered solutions using computational thinking frameworks.

## Project Description

The website addresses a critical ethical scenario faced by ICT professionals: when asked to implement an AI solution that could render an entire department redundant, what is the ethical path forward? This project argues for a hybrid strategy where technology amplifies human capabilities rather than replacing them entirely.

## Key Topics Covered

### Ethical Considerations
- Professional responsibility in AI deployment
- Stakeholder impact analysis (profession, organization, community)
- Duty of care to employees and colleagues
- Privacy and security by design
- Justice and fairness in workforce transitions

### Computational Thinking Framework
The project applies five computational thinking principles to navigate the ethical dilemma:

1. **Decomposition** - Separating AI-suitable tasks from those requiring human judgment
2. **Pattern Recognition** - Learning from successful automation rollouts
3. **Abstraction** - Focusing on core ethical and legal constraints
4. **Algorithmic Thinking** - Creating phased implementation plans
5. **Evaluation** - Tracking outcomes and iterating based on results

### Proposed Solutions
- Phased adoption with human-in-the-loop safeguards
- Role redesign pairing AI capabilities with human oversight
- Reskilling programs for affected employees
- Governance frameworks including AI risk registers
- Post-deployment audits and rollback plans

## Technical Implementation

The website is built using modern web technologies:

- **HTML5** - Semantic structure with accessibility considerations
- **CSS3** - Responsive design with clean, professional styling
- **JavaScript** - Interactive navigation and smooth scrolling
