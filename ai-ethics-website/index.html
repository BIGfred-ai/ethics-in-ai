      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In modern ICT, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can deliver major gains in accuracy, speed,
        and cost—yet those same gains can threaten human roles when deployed without safeguards.
        This site examines a realistic scenario: your boss asks you to use AI to code a solution;
        testing shows it will replace the core work of your entire department. The ethical question:
        <em>Do you ship it anyway, or design a human‑centred path forward?</em> This project argues
        for a hybrid strategy where technology amplifies people, guided by professional ethics and
        computational thinking.

      <h2>Artificial Intelligence in ICT</h2>
      <p>
        AI now supports software generation, testing, incident triage, analytics, and compliance
        monitoring. Benefits include faster delivery and fewer defects; risks include skill atrophy,
        deskilling, and over‑reliance on opaque systems. Ethical practice requires aligning AI use
        with professional codes, privacy law, and stakeholder interests, while preserving pathways
        for human expertise and innovation.

    <section id="dilemma">
      <h2>The Ethical Dilemma: Automation‑Induced Redundancy</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Scenario.</strong> You build the requested AI solution and discover it would render
        your department largely redundant. Stakeholders are affected differently:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Profession.</strong> Erosion of roles, reduced mentoring pipelines, loss of tacit knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong>Client/Organisation.</strong> Short‑term savings vs. long‑term resilience, quality, and risk posture.</li>
        <li><strong>Community.</strong> Local employment impacts and broader social costs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The ethical tension is clear: deliver immediate efficiency or recommend a plan that protects
        people, service quality, and public trust.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="implications">
      <h2>Ethical Implications & Concrete Solutions</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Implications.</strong> Duty of care to staff; professional responsibility to avoid
        harm; privacy and security by design; transparency about AI limits; justice and fairness in
        workforce transitions.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Phased adoption.</strong> Ship non‑critical automation first; retain human‑in‑the‑loop for critical work.</li>
        <li><strong>Role redesign.</strong> Pair AI with people: AI drafts/tests; humans review, audit, and handle edge cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Reskilling.</strong> Fund training pathways (prompt engineering, evaluation, security, and governance roles).</li>
        <li><strong>Governance.</strong> Establish an AI risk register, change‑control board, and metrics for quality, safety, and equity.</li>
        <li><strong>Safeguards.</strong> Document model limitations, privacy controls, and rollback plans; run post‑deployment audits.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Computational Thinking Playbook</h2>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Decomposition</h3>
          <p>Separate tasks where AI excels (patterned, repetitive, large‑scale) from tasks requiring human judgment, context, and accountability.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Pattern Recognition</h3>
          <p>Study prior automation rollouts: successful programs phase in, measure impacts, and protect knowledge transfer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Abstraction</h3>
          <p>Filter noise: the core decision is balancing efficiency with human value and legal/ethical constraints.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Algorithmic Thinking</h3>
          <p>Create a stepwise plan: pilot → evaluate → reskill → expand. Include gates for safety, quality, and fairness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Evaluation</h3>
          <p>Track outcomes (defects, incidents, customer satisfaction, job transition success) and iterate accordingly.</p>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Ethical AI in ICT means choosing human‑centred design over blunt replacement. Phased
        deployment, transparent governance, and role redesign keep systems safe and organisations
        resilient—while protecting people and the profession.
